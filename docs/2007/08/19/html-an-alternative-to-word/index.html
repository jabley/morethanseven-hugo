    <p>When I&rsquo;m writing code, be it CSS, Javascript, Ruby, whatever, I don&rsquo;t like big bulky IDE&rsquo;s. Give me <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or Vim any day. Going all freelance I now have the occasional need to produce nice documents and being in charge means I get to decide what I use to produce them. I never really liked working in Microsoft Word so decided against it. But rather than sensibly going for an obviously alternative I decided to just use HTML, or rather more specifically, <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOnlineDocs.png" alt="An example of a current document" title="An example of a current document" /></p>

<p>As an old time <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a> I learned to love the simple text transformation language and it&rsquo;s inclusion in the <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> apps made me smile and more likely to use them. Why use it over HTML you may ask? For me I think about HTML like a browser, as a tree of nodes. I end up spending quite a bit of time writing content then going backwards and wrapping what I just wrote in markup. This is fine for your typical site, but for writing documents it&rsquo;s hard to get into a flow. With textile I can flow in one direction.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m liking it alot. I can seperate content from presentation (Word styles are a myth), easily repurpose my content (text, html, pdf) and write documents in anything I like, including Word if I chose to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a pretty good excuse to play with various bits of CSS3, including multi-columns, advanced layout, generated content and the various print offerings. Given I can control the rendering engine then produce a PDF to distribute I can use anything that the latest browser builds can deal with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not got all the workflow steps automated yet, I&rsquo;m using Firefox to print documents to PDF (via Preview) at the moment which works fine but is still a manual process I can get rid of using something like <a href="http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/">css2xslfo</a> and <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">fop</a>. I&rsquo;m also pretty sure the PDFs won&rsquo;t be accessible, although the original markup certainly should be.</p>

<p>As I produce more complex documents I&rsquo;ll likely miss things like automated table of contents generation, footnotes and page numbering but, then again, I can write that in Javascript (or on the server) if I so choose. I was impressed listening to HÃ¥kon Wium Lie at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a> about the process they used to format his last book using CSS and <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>. I&rsquo;m half tempted to spend time rolling all this together into a web app. It would be pretty good fun really; APIs, XSLT, CSS, PDF, some nice UI problems, etc. Only problem I see would be entering a market contested by Microsoft, Google, Sun and er, lots of others.</p>
