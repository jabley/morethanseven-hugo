More of a statement of intend, for posterity’s sake hopefully. Something I can look back on and think “Oh, yeah, I meant to do that” later in the year. Also so I dont forget, or just decide I couldn’t be bothered. Why this all of a sudden? Well, it’s the start of the new year anyway, but in particular the first meetup of people from the <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> list got me thinking. And in particular more than thinking, wanting to act on existing thoughts.

</p>
<p>
So, without further ado, here is a brief list of thinks I’m going to do this year – fingers crossed, in no partricular order and missing several things that no one reading this will care about:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Get as much out of the <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Future of Web Apps Summit</a> as possible. I’m pretty interested in the <em>design</em> of applications at the moment.

</li>
<li>
Not still have a hangover for the <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/services/training/ajax.php">Ajax training session</a> with <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a> two days after the summit.

</li>
<li>
Get an article written and published in something I read.

</li>
<li>
Package up the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia2006">feed syndicator</a> code base under a decent name and release it for anyone to use.

</li>
<li>
Produce a real application using <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>.

</li>
<li>
Somehow get to all four (or is it five, I can’t remember) of the <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">`media</a> themed nights out &#8211; as well as as many of the workshops and presentations one personn can get to without <a href="http://www.muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/01/5/`media2006.php"&gt;cloning</a>

</li>
<li>
On the back of our first real local meetup get a few projects moving. Everyone put email addresses to faces, which I think was important, and should make getting together doing something active easier from now on.

</li>
<li>
And finally something vague; (note that this isn’t me with an idea under wraps, this is as far as I’ve got!) Design and build something <em>of use</em> to the wider web community.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I may have forgetten a couple of things, I’ll add them as I see fit. Anyone else got a list that they would like to share? Either on here or post a link to your own site.
