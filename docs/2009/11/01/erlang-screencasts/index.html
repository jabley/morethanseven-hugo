    <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn Erlang for a while. What I actually mean is it&rsquo;s been on my list of <em>things to learn</em> for months, along with all sorts of other incredibly interesting bits and pieces. I spend a little bit of time at home but the majority of my learning time is now spent commuting to London and back most days. Sometimes I&rsquo;m even going all the way to Swindon which gives me even longer to not learn Erlang.</p>

<p>The main problem with learning something new on the train is space. Reading a book (or my new Kindle) or just using my laptop is fine. Trying to do both at once is nearly impossible (I&rsquo;ve tried). So I&rsquo;ve decided to give another approach a try, namely screencasts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only done the first <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">Erlang in Practice</a> episode so far but I was hugely impressed with the content and general presentation. $5 as well doesn&rsquo;t seem bad at all I don&rsquo;t think. The episode was half an hour long, but took me a little longer, probably closer to 45 minutes, as I was playing along at home and typing the code examples as I went. I also got sidetracked with messing with my vim configuration at the same time but hey. This makes them perfect for my hour long commute. The full series is 8 episodes long and with luck I&rsquo;ll be able to work through them this week.</p>

<p>So, good job <a href="http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Pragmatic</a> for a nice, accessible start to Erlang. All I need to do now is find something interesting to hack on in Erlang.</p>
