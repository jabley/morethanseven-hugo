I’m something of a fan of mobile devices and really should do more mobile web stuff but hey, the support for mobile CSS is shody at best. Enter <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/07/make-your-site-mobile-friendly">this article</a>.

</p>
<p>
The idea is really pretty simple. All you really want when your paying for bandwidth on your phone (or you PDA connected to your phone via bluetooth) is the content. So lets get rid of everything (and we mean everything) else. The solution is fairly devious – using some PHP jiggery pokery, a sub domain and some text parsing.

</p>
<p>
Have a look at <a href="http://mobile.morethanseven.net">mobile.morethanseven.net</a> for an example on this site.

</p>
<p>
In reality it’s a non ideal solution, but considerng it really does take two minutes I dont see that as a problem, and I think that was what the author of the article was getting at. We want to use mobile CSS but some browsers ignore it while others pretend they are grown up browsers and try and render the whole site CSS file.

</p>
<p>
I’m hopefully going to alter this a little, rather than removing all stylesheets leaving any mobile media sheets intact. Assign these to the main site and we have an interim solution. Fancy devices that make use of the correct style sheets can use the main domain fine, others can get the same design by visiting the mobile sub domain.

Been a little busy with the new job but had chance to do a few behind the scenes bits and pieces, including:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
valid and formatted feed

</li>
<li>
blogroll from <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/projects/12">StripComments </a> project

</li>
<li>
autocomplete on search box (type c, x or p)

</li>
<li>
added <a href="http://www.textism.com">Textile</a> formatting for posts

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Should be back with more soon. I need to reply to phil (<a href="http://xlab.co.uk">xlab</a>) about my musical preferences, jot down notes on using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> as an online feed reader and a web standards redoing of the <a href="http://www.qwikiwiki.com">QWikiWiki</a> output layer that I’m part way through.

<strong>\[UPDATE\]</strong> Visiting the website I now find out that after the next mini issue it’s all over for Design in Flight. I can see how it could take over someone’s life considering the quality but I for one would have paid more to keep it around.

</p>
<p>
I’ve just got round to buying all the back issues of Design in Flight (<a href="http://www.designinflight.com">www.designinflight.com</a>) magazine – which features articles on design, web development and similar fields.

</p>
<p>
For only 10 dollars (via Pay Pal) for the 4 issues it seems excellent value at about 150 pages or so, brimming with interesting information.

</p>
<p>
I’ve obviously not read that much as yet but so far so good and for the price you cant really go wrong.

After a little work I’ve put together an app to keep up to date with all the news around `media. Based on the collection of feeds from <a href="http://kurafire.net">kurafire.net</a> it collects and filters for posts for `media references and displays them.

</p>
<p>
I’m hoping it will proove useful to anyone else who wants to keep up to date. Especially when details start coming up about next year and in the lead up to that.

</p>
<p>
Have a look at <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia">morethanseven.net/atmedia</a>. If you have any more feeds just let me know – I want it to be as extensive as possible.

I now have an ASP.NET environment setup and ready to go and the will to use it. Depending on how it goes I’ll try and post any thoughts as I go. In particularly related to how I get on with good standards markup.

</p>
<p>
I can knock together whatever I want in PHP reasonably well and with my new job focusing on CSS and XHTML amongst other related bits, and working at .NET shop I thought I now have a reason to play.

With all the goings on off the back of @media its pretty hard to keep up. Many of the ideas that where discussed seem to be taking hold and coming into the world and lots of sites have had some recdent TLC. Anyway, here goes with a few observations.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Simplified Standards</strong>
Simplifiedstandards (<a href="http://www.simplifiedstandards.com/">simplifiedstandards.com</a>) looks like a great idea. A few people where discussing a central repository for concensus on issues of web standards application in the real world and this aims to be just that. Simon Collison of <a href="http://www.collylogic.com">www.collylogic.com</a> is bringing everything together as far as I can see.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Everyones thoughts</strong>
Faruk AteÃ…Å¸ appears to have spent every day since getting back compiling a list of what anyone anywhere said about the event. Its a great idea and makes finding peoples thoughts easier but I wonder if their would be an easy way of doing this (like pinging a web service with any new articles?) without one guy doing all the work?
Look for everyones comments at <a href="http://www.kurafire.net/log/archive/2005/06/11/atmedia-2005-report">kurafire.net</a>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Designersinhouse</strong>
One guy I did meet at the conference was Matt Patterson who has set up a small (but radidly growing) mainling list over at <a href="http://www.designersinhouse.com">www.designersinhouse.com</a> aimed at designers working within larger organisations. One thing I took away from the conference was the large number of people working outside service or agency environments.

</p>
<p>
And that is just some of the goings on. A good amount of discussion going on around the level of legislation needed to govern accessibility doing the rounds, the ATF (Accessibility TaskForce) from WaSP just starting up with several of the speakers on board and god knows what else. Oh, and I still haven’t done a zoom layout but I did add some word completion to the search box!

I’ve just install the ShortStat package from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com">www.shauninman.com</a> and the Mac OS X widget from <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/">www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/</a> to go along with it. My desktop now tells me how few people are visiting my site!

</p>
<p>
It’s the first really useful widget I can see myself using for more than pure eye candy.

</p>
<p>
And ShortStat itself seems to be a very nice addition. Simple to set up and the output is nice and clear.

</p>
<p>
To both the people visiting the site – dont worry I wont use your browsing habits for anything other than improving the site!

It’s official. It’s DOM Scripting.

</p>
<p>
I’m reading the DHTML Utopia book at the moment (excellent so far) and following on from @Media it does seem to be where it’s at, at least for a little while.

</p>
<p>
The discussion of naming raised it’s head and I kind of agree – AJAX has buzz word written all over it. Read the full article at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/you_shouldve_be_1.html">quirksmode.org</a> following on from the Javascript get together after @media (darn train tickets).

</p>
<p>
If CSS is too much for designery types just wait… CSS, without its programmatic concepts (variables? arrays? etc.) is one thing but Javascript is, lets remember, an Object Orientated scripting language. Interesting to see who ends up doing this sort of work in small companies with limited people.

Sorry for the title. As a few people already know I’m moving jobs at the end of the month to Th\_nk. Basically to do more web design with the emphasis on XHTML, CSS and the like.

</p>
<p>
I’m not going to go on about it as I’m trying to stick to issues on here about web stuff rather than about me but thought it worth a post.
